## Developer Documentation: Technical Architecture and Stack Overview
Our technical infrastructure is designed to be robust and scalable, leveraging a variety of technologies and services. Below is a detailed breakdown of our current setup:

### Frontend

- **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Description**: The frontend is a simple setup consisting of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

### Domain Management

- **Registrar**: One.com
- **Description**: We've registered our domain (`wowen.tech`) and all associated subdomains with One.com. As of now, we intend to continue using One.com as our domain registrar due to its other convenient features.

### Hosting and Deployment

- **Platform**: Netlify
- **Description**: We use Netlify for hosting and deployment. We've set up the DNS settings on One.com to point to Netlify, which serves as the platform for both our frontend hosting and deployment.

### Form Collection

- **Netlify Forms**: Used to collect contact forms on `/contact` and `/sv/kontakt`.
- **Tally**: Used to collect applicant forms on `/careers` and `/sv/jobb/`.

### Analytics

- **Google Analytics**: Used for web traffic analysis.
- **Plausible**: An additional tool for web traffic analysis.
- **Google Tag Manager**: Used for managing tags on the website.

### Future Considerations

As of now, we plan to continue using Netlify for hosting and deployment and One.com for domain management. However, we are evaluating other options for hosting and domain management, potentially transitioning to AWS Services or Vercel.
